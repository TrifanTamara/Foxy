To do:
-delete n4 from documentation, only 1% n5 :D
-add front images
-create logo and images
-add sound to ALL kanji and words
-Maybe add two stages of flow: slower and faster (for user)
-fix review meaning and reading check, to be more tolerant
-implement kana table on input


Rules:
-User can see unlocked items info, but cannot force it progress on them.
